<p>Hi, I am Sonya, an educator and digital creator who loves brainstorming new ideas and fostering critical thinking in others to make life easier. Iam passionate about technology, finance, self-care, mental wellness, beautiful things, and creating Christ-centered opportunities for people to come together using God given gifts and talents to support and heal one another.

<p>I  was born and raised in the Chicagoland area. This is perhaps my 20th year in education. I have worked with scholars in early childhood through college. I wanted to take some risks, learn more, and become great at another long-time interest. Therefore, I have ventured out into the world of technology.

<p>Technology is what is currently shaping our future and world today. I incorporate technology in all aspects and subjects of instruction. I incorporate Web based games and opportunities into my teaching and learning. I want to create a place for others to learn and grow with an emphasis on innovation, AI, and digital creation. You can find me improving up on skills everyday. I am learning to find a need in the both the industry of education and virtual creations.
